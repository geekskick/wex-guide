In this section we will use our feathers to send some messages to each other. Fortunately this is pretty simple to get started with thanks to the code provided by the RadioHead-Extras library provided.
For further information on Arduino libraries consult the Arduino website\footnote{\url{https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Libraries}}

\cfbox{red}{ Open up the provided SimpleFSKSend.ino sketch and the SimpleFSKRx.ino files in the Arduino editor and load them on to different feathers. } 

You should see that one is sending a message and the other is receiving it, and printing it to the serial monitor. This is our secret message! Try changing the code to send another message but for now keep the settings of the \gls{RF} chip the same, we will come back and change them later.
